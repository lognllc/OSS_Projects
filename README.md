# Nature
The nature of this repository is to have a unified place to list all the open source projects we are working on or planning on work on.

# What this repository is for
To check what projects, tools or ideas we are currently developing as `OSS` and what's the status on each project as well as comments on the company's culture and current `OSS` work.

# What this repository is NOT for
* Submit `OSS` projects developed by other companies or developers.
* Ask for new tools, etc.

# Why we created this?
Following the steps of many companies that have gone `OSS` (e.g. [GitHub][1], [Venmo][2], [Artsy][3]) and some developers from our company that strived to achieve same level of openness we decided to start contributing back.

After an `Android` talk that inspired some ideas we decided to pull the trigger and start working on some of those `OSS` projects.
